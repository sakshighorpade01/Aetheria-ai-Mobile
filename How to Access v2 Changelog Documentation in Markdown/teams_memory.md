The team can also manage user memories, just like agents:

    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    
    db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")
    
    team_with_memory = Team(
        name="Team with Memory",
        members=[agent1, agent2],
        db=db,
        enable_user_memories=True,
    )
    
    team_with_memory.print_response("Hi! My name is John Doe.")
    team_with_memory.print_response("What is my name?")
    

See more in the [Memory]() section.
